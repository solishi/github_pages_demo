## Projects

<ProjectCard image="/projects/1.png">

  **IOT canteen**

  :house:Taihuiren Company

  *Face-recognition,Signal transmission,Tomcat,Mysql, Django,E-chart*

- [Vue.js](https://github.com/solishi/yunlin)

Learned about and implemented facial recognition, signal transmission, Tomcat, MySQL, Django, and ECharts. Collected data related to food waste by using electronic scales. Applied Bluetooth to transport local data. Wrote optimized
analysis algorithms for data. Displayed real-time results charts on a 40-inch monitor. Encouraged employees to reduce
their food waste.

  **Object Classification**

  :school:University of Bishops

  *Yolo loss,deep learning*


  Acquired knowledge about and used Yolo loss as well as deep learning. Rewrote the yolo loss function to provide
better object classification from a visual object classes (VOC) dataset. Created a new model based on a pre-trained Detnet
model to reduce computing power costs.

  **Automatic way finding robot**

  :school:University of Michigan

  *C,opencv,Raspberry Pi,Wireless transmission*


  Learned about and implemented C, OpenCV, Raspberry Pi, and wireless transmission. Utilized the A* algorithm to
enable a robot to find a special object within a room and reach its location. Studied inverse kinematics, rewrote inner
control connections to improve this robotâ€™s travel trajectory; practiced implementing embedded systems on a Raspberry
Pi board.

  **IOT classroom**

  :house:Taihuiren Company
  *Embedded Systems*


  Analyzed and applied embedded systems. Created an entire IOT system that included screens, audio technology,
a professional video recording system, as well as light control that included curtains and access control. Developed an
online class recording system in this e-classroom that involved different scenarios. Added a pandemic prevention module
in which the access control system and temperature measurement were networked with local safety and health sectors.
